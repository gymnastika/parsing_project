- ✅ Unicode overlong UTF-8 blocked

#### CORS Security (4/4 tests passed)
- ✅ Malicious origins blocked (`evil.com`)
- ✅ Null origin blocked
- ✅ Wildcard bypass attempts prevented
- ✅ Valid origins allowed (`localhost:3001`)

#### HTTP Method Security (4/6 tests - 2 medium issues)
- ✅ TRACE method returns 404
- ⚠️  **MEDIUM**: TRACK method allowed (returns 400)
- ⚠️  **MEDIUM**: DEBUG method allowed (returns 400)  
- ✅ DELETE method returns 404
- ✅ PUT method returns 404
- ✅ PATCH method returns 404

#### Authentication Security (3/3 tests passed)
- ✅ Authorization header injection handled gracefully
- ✅ Cookie injection handled gracefully

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### Medium Priority (2 issues)
1. **HTTP Method Security**: Explicitly disable TRACK and DEBUG methods
   ```javascript
   // Add to server.js
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     if (['TRACK', 'DEBUG'].includes(req.method)) {
       return res.status(405).send('Method Not Allowed');
     }
     next();
   });
   ```

### Low Priority (2 issues)
1. **XSS Header**: Update X-XSS-Protection header value
   ```javascript
   // In helmet configuration
   xssFilter: { setOnOldIE: true }
   ```

2. **Small Payload Validation**: Consider adding minimum validation for very small payloads
